# Course Creator

The Course Creation is a wizard that gives users a quick way to create courses within a category. It sits under the course category menu.

Courses can be created based on an existing course within the category, based on a template that is added in any category and as a blank course.

The settings page for the plugin has the option to add Groups of templates like templates for different schools. Each group can then be populated with course ids.

A very useful tool to setup courses at the beginning of an academic year or a programme.
